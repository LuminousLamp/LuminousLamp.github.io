							This is a virtual reality (VR) mini-game using Unreal Engine 5 (UE5). The game is set in a study room inspired by the daily life of computer science engineering students in University of Michigan, featuring interactive elements like tables, chairs, and computers. Through engaging interactions and playful scenarios, the game blends realism with fun to reflect the technological environment that defines student life. Built using UE5's VR template and Blueprint scripting, the project demonstrates my ability to develop immersive, interactive experiences in virtual environments.
							
							We've added various custom objects such as solid-state drives, computer memory, Mac Minis, keyboards, and more. CSE students often face a lot of challenges when running their computer programs, like system crashes, segmentation faults, running out of memory, or disk space. Finding solutions to these problems is a constant struggle. This simulation replicates those challenges, giving players a glimpse into the daily life of a CSE student. Players can restart their computers by clicking on the computer case, resolve segmentation faults by clicking on the keyboard, and even purchase and install additional RAM or SSDs to resolve performance issues.

							We also developed a game controller architecture that manages and controls the entire game. An automated and randomized control algorithm was implemented to adjust the game's development, offering a unique experience each time the game is played.
